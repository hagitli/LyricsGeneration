# LyricsGeneration

In this task, we trained a neural net to generate lyrics based on the provided melody.

During the training of the model, we had access to the lyrics of a song and its melody. The melodies are stored in .mid (MIDI files) and contain various types of information â€“ notes, the instruments used, etc. we experiment with different methods to incorporate this information with the lyrics.

During the test phase, we generate lyrics for a provided melody automatically, based on the first input word.
